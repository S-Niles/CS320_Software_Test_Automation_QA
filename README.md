Questions:

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

#Attention to detail and diligence are some of the most important factors during the creation of quality code for a program/software to ensure functionality and security are upheld. Taking the time to review all necessary requirements at different stages of the process will make it easier to stay within the lines of what the final program is to entail. Although constant reviews can be burdensome and inefficient if performed too often, more familiarity can save technical debt down the road, as all key pieces of functionality will be included in the development process. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

#Ask questions, read and listen to what the user/customer wants their desired piece of software or program to do. Not everyone is able to correct explain their desires in the written or spoken word, which is why communication can be such an integral part if there seems to be a misunderstanding. As a professional, I can certialy take the liberty to interpret anything ambigous on my own. However, this approach can lead a developer down the wrong path and waste potentially important and vital time constraints. 

How do I approach designing software?

#I have found that thoroughly reading the requirements beforehand is the best practice for me. Once I have a good understanding of everything that needs to be involved I can then break a piece of software down and focus on individual aspects. However, as I spoke about above, losing focus on the big picture can lead to inconsistencies or deficiencies down the road. Even a broad understanding of all requirements up front lessens the likelihood that something will be incorrectly implemented or forgotten.
